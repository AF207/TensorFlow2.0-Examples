## [RPN: RegionProposal Network](https://github.com/YunYang1994/Easy-Deep-Learning/blob/master/RPN.md)
--------------------

This repository is implemented for the paper ["Expecting the Unexpected: Training Detectors for Unusual Pedestrians with Adversarial Imposters(CVPR2017)"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06283), which makes some improvements on the basis of region proposal network in FasterRCNN.

## Synthetic datasets
--------------------

For training RPN, I use synthetic datasets which contains a set of 8239 images with one class (`pedestrian`). The data is available on the [BaiduCloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QZAIakMVS0sJV0sjgv7v2w&shfl=sharepset). We isotropically scale each image to a resolution of 960Ã—720, zero-padding as necessary.

## Anchors Demo
--------------------
I think the most exciting things in the region proposal network is Anchors. I use 9 anchors at each sliding position. During training, a candidate bounding box will be treated as a positive if its intersection-over-union overlap with a ground-truth box exceeds 50%, and will be a negative for overlaps less than 10%. 

```bashrc
$ python demo.py
```

## Network Training
--------------------

First of all, you need to download [synthetic datasets](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QZAIakMVS0sJV0sjgv7v2w&shfl=sharepset) and put it in `./`, then

```bashrc
$ python train.py
```
the model will automatically save weights `RPN.h5` in each epoch. Finally you can test `RPN.h5` with test.py
