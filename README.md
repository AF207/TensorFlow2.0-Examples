> continue to learn, continue to work, continue to update!

This tutorial was designed for easily diving into TensorFlow2.0.  it includes both notebooks and source codes with explanation.

#### 1 - Introduction
- **Hello World** ([notebook](1-Introduction/helloworld.ipynb)) ([code](1-Introduction/helloworld.py)). Very simple example to learn how to print "hello world" using TensorFlow.
- **Variable** ([notebook](1-Introduction/variable.ipynb)) ([code](1-Introduction/variable.py)). Learn to use variable in tensorflow.
- **Basical operation** ([notebook](1-Introduction/basic_operations.ipynb)) ([code](1-Introduction/basic_operations.py)). A simple example that covers TensorFlow basic operations.
- **GradientTape** ([notebook](1-Introduction/GradientTape.ipynb)) ([code](1-Introduction/GradientTape.py)). Introduce a key technique for automatic differentiation
